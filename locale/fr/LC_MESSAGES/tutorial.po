"As already said in introduction, an OSGeoLive virtual machine image disk has"

"to be the simplest way to use ZOO Kernel and to develop ZOO Services "
"locally, as we can ensure that everything requested for compile C Services "
"and run Python Services is available and ready to use. Every ZOO related "
"material and source code have been placed in */home/user/zoows* directory. "
"We will work inside it during this workshop. As the binary version of ZOO "
"Kernel is already compiled and stored in */home/user/zoows/sources/zoo-"

"need them for a specific Service. Nevertheless, you have to know that the "
"env section name is used in a specific way. It lets you define environment "
"variables that your Service requires during its runtime. For instance, if "
"your Service requires to access to a X server running on framebuffer, you "
"can add *DISPLAY=:1* line in your env section to take this specificity into "
