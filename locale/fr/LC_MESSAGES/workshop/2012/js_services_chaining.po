"ZOO-API and ZOO-Kernel JavaScript support make you able to run services "

"To support JavaScript language ZOO-Kernel use the `SpiderMonkey "
"<https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey>`__ API to create a "
"javascript runtime environment from which it will load your JS file then "
"extract the function corresponding to the service to run it using the "
"prefilled parameters. The JavaScript runtime environment created by the ZOO-"
"Kernel depend on your setup. If you placed the ``ZOO-api.js`` and ``ZOO-"
"proj4js.js`` in the same directory as your ZOO-Kernel it means that your "
"environment will contains ZOO-API and Proj4js will be loaded before your "
"service. In such case you can access to the Classes defined in the "
