"First you may verify if the ZOO-Services are available from your current "
"setup. You can take a look at the ``Buffer.zcfg``, ``Intersection.zcfg`` and"
" ``DifferencePy.zcfg`` to get details about parameters. As you can see from "
"the ZCFG files, you will use ZOO-Services provided by the ``foss4g_ws`` "
"Python service provider. So if you want to modify the Python code you will "
"have to edit this file. You are invited to use similar requests as you seen "
"in previous sections to learn about each service."
