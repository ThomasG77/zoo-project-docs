It supports seven programming languages, thus allowing you to create Web Services using the one you prefer. It also lets you use an existing code and to turn it as a WPS Service. The current supported programming languages are the following:"

Despite a pre-compiled ZOO 1.3-dev package is provided inside OSGeoLive, some optional supports are not available in the default setup. So you will be invited to download and uncompress a tarbal containing binary versions of ZOO-Kernel, so there is no need to compile anything, simple steps to install ZOO-Kernel will be introduced. Configuration file and basic ways to run ZOO Kernel and ZOO Service will be presented. Then you will be invited to start programming your own simple service using Python language. Some ZOO Services will be presented and individually tested inside a ready-to-use OpenLayers application. Finally, this services will be chained using the server-side Javascript ZOO API."
