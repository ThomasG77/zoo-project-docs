msgid "First you may verify if the ZOO-Services are available from your current setup. You can take a look at the ``Buffer.zcfg``, ``Intersection.zcfg`` and ``DifferencePy.zcfg`` to get details about parameters. As you can see from the ZCFG files, you will use ZOO-Services provided by the ``service`` Python service provider. So if you want to modify the Python code you will have to edit the corresponding file (so ``service.py``). You are invited to use similar requests as the one used in previous sections to learn about each services individually."

The WFS protocol is also used as the input value for the profile computation. So, the computation was run once and accessed three times for different purposes and from different clients."
