msgid "First you may verify if the ZOO-Services are available from your current setup. You can take a look at the ``Buffer.zcfg``, ``Intersection.zcfg`` and ``DifferencePy.zcfg`` to get details about parameters. As you can see from the ZCFG files, you will use ZOO-Services provided by the ``foss4g_ws`` Python service provider. So if you want to modify the Python code you will have to edit this file. You are invited to use similar requests as you seen in previous sections to learn about each service."
