msgid "In this really short example you can see how to create ``ZOO.Process`` class instance and call the Execute method on such an instance. Then you'll just need to return a JavaScript object containing the attributes result and outputs, which I'm sure you already know what is about. The first is about the status of the process (can be ``ZOO.SERVICE_SUCEEDED``, ``ZOO.SERVICE_FAILED`` and so on), the last is obviously the resulting maps (take a look at the maps internal data structure used by ZOO Kernel in ``service.h``)."
