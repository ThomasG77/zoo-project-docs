msgid "As already said in introduction, an OSGeoLive virtual machine image disk has been installed on your computer, allowing you to use ZOO Kernel in a development environment directly. Using a virtual machine image disk seems to be the simplest way to use ZOO Kernel and to develop ZOO Services locally, as we can ensure that everything requested for compile C Services and run Python Services is available and ready to use. Every ZOO related material and source code have been placed in */home/user/zoows* directory. We will work inside it during this workshop. As the binary version of ZOO Kernel is already compiled and stored in */home/user/zoows/sources/zoo-kernel*, you only have to copy two important files inside the */usr/lib/cgi-bin directory*: *zoo_loader.cgi* and the *main.cfg* in order to make ZOO Kernel available, using the following commands:"

msgid "The *main.cfg* file contains metadata informations about the identification and provider but also some important settings. The file is composed of various sections, namely *main*, *identification* and *provider* per default. Obviously, you are free to add new sections to the files if you need them for a specific Service. Nevertheless, you have to know that the env section name is used in a specific way. It lets you define environment variables that your Service requires during its runtime. For instance, if your Service requires to access to a X server running on framebuffer, you can add *DISPLAY=:1* line in your env section to take this specificity into account."
